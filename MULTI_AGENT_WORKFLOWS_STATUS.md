## What's Planned (From MULTI_AGENT_WORKFLOWS_PLAN.md)

### 1. **Workflow Engine** 📋 Not Built

**Purpose**: Orchestrate multi-step processes with conditional logic

**Planned Features**:
- Step-by-step workflow execution
- Conditional branching (if/then logic)
- Parallel step execution
- State management and persistence
- Error recovery with retries
- Fallback workflows

**Example Workflow Definition**:
```javascript
{
  id: "booking_flow",
  steps: [
    {
      id: "qualify",
      agent: "qualifier_agent",
      input: ["customer_message"],
      output: ["is_qualified", "lead_score"],
      retries: 2
    },
    {
      id: "schedule",
      agent: "scheduling_agent",
      condition: "is_qualified === true",
      retries: 3
    },
    {
      id: "confirm",
      agent: "confirmation_agent",
      retries: 2
    }
  ]
}
```

**Status**: Not implemented

#### 2.1 Qualifier Agent 📋
**Purpose**: Qualify leads and score opportunities
- Lead scoring (0-100)
- Service type detection
- Urgency assessment
- Budget range estimation

**Status**: Not built

#### 2.2 Pricing Agent 📋
**Purpose**: Calculate quotes and estimates
- Dynamic pricing calculation
- Cost breakdown generation
- Discount eligibility
- Custom quote generation

**Status**: Not built

#### 2.3 Confirmation Agent 📋
**Purpose**: Send confirmations and follow-ups
- Email confirmations
- SMS notifications
- Calendar invites
- Follow-up scheduling

**Status**: Not built

#### 2.4 Negotiation Agent 📋 (Future)
**Purpose**: Handle price negotiations
- Offer counter-proposals
- Apply discounts
- Upsell services
- Close deals

**Status**: Not built

---

### 3. **Workflow Templates** 📋 Designed

Four workflow templates designed but not implemented:

#### 3.1 Simple Booking Flow
```
Inquiry → Collect Info → Book → Confirm
```
- **Use Case**: Standard residential cleaning
- **Duration**: ~5 minutes
- **Steps**: 4

**Status**: Can be done with current SchedulingAgent

#### 3.2 Complex Sales Flow
```
Inquiry → Qualify → Price → Negotiate → Schedule → Contract → Confirm
```
- **Use Case**: Commercial contracts, large properties
- **Duration**: 15-30 minutes
- **Steps**: 7

**Status**: Requires multiple agents (not built)

#### 3.3 Emergency Flow
```
Emergency → Triage → Priority Schedule → Immediate Confirm
```
- **Use Case**: Emergency cleaning (water/fire damage)
- **Duration**: ~2 minutes
- **Steps**: 4 (fast-tracked)

**Status**: Requires specialized triage logic (not built)

#### 3.4 Recurring Service Flow
```
Initial Booking → Contract Setup → Recurring Schedule → Auto-Renewal
```
- **Use Case**: Weekly/monthly recurring services
- **Duration**: 10 min initial, then automatic
- **Steps**: 4 + automation

**Status**: Requires automation logic (not built)

---

### 4. **Task Queue System** 📋 Not Built

**Purpose**: Manage async execution of workflow steps

**Planned Features**:
- Priority-based task execution (1-10 scale)
- Async task processing
- Load balancing across agents
- Retry management
- Timeout handling

**Priority Levels**:
- Emergency (10): Immediate response
- High (7-9): Same-day, high-value leads
- Normal (4-6): Standard bookings
- Low (1-3): Follow-ups, non-urgent

**Execution Strategies**:
- Sequential: Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3
- Parallel: Step 1 → [Step 2A, 2B, 2C] → Step 3

**Status**: Not implemented

---

### 5. **State Management** 📋 Not Built

**Purpose**: Track workflow progress and share data between steps

**Planned Features**:
- Workflow state persistence
- Step status tracking
- Context sharing across agents
- Error history
- State recovery on failure

**State Structure**:
```javascript
{
  workflowId: "wf_abc123",
  executionId: "exec_xyz789",
  status: "in_progress",
  currentStep: "schedule",
  steps: {
    qualify: { status: "completed", output: {...} },
    schedule: { status: "in_progress", retries: 1 }
  },
  context: {
    // Shared data across steps
    customer_id: "cust_123",
    service_type: "deep_cleaning"
  }
}
```

**Database Schema** (planned):
```sql
CREATE TABLE workflow_executions (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  workflow_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT NOT NULL,
  current_step TEXT,
  state TEXT, -- JSON
  context TEXT, -- JSON
  started_at DATETIME,
  completed_at DATETIME
);
```

**Status**: Not implemented (table doesn't exist)

---

### 6. **Error Handling & Recovery** 📋 Designed

**Retry Strategies** (planned):
- Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s
- Fixed delay: 5s between each retry
- Per-step retry limits

**Fallback Workflows**:
- Primary workflow fails → Switch to simpler fallback
- Example: Complex Sales Flow → Simple Booking Flow

**Human-in-the-Loop Escalation**:
- Trigger conditions:
  - All retries exhausted
  - Critical step fails
  - Customer requests human
  - Workflow timeout exceeded

**Status**: Strategy designed but not coded

---

## Current Implementation Status

## Use Cases (When Implemented)

### Scenario 1: Emergency Water Damage Cleanup

**Current (Single Agent)**:
- Customer describes emergency
- Agent tries to book appointment
- May struggle with urgency/pricing

**With Multi-Agent (Future)**:
```
1. Triage Agent → Identifies emergency (HIGH priority)
2. Pricing Agent → Calculates emergency rate ($500 + $150/hr)
3. Scheduling Agent → Finds next available slot (within 2 hours)
4. Confirmation Agent → Sends immediate SMS + assigns crew
```
**Time**: 90 seconds vs 5+ minutes currently

### Scenario 2: Large Commercial Contract

**Current (Single Agent)**:
- Complex negotiation in single conversation
- No structured pricing
- Manual quote generation

**With Multi-Agent (Future)**:
```
1. Qualifier Agent → Scores lead (85/100), identifies decision maker
2. Pricing Agent → Custom quote ($2,500/month for weekly service)
3. Negotiation Agent → Handles discount request (10% → $2,250)
4. Scheduling Agent → Sets recurring schedule (every Monday 9am)
5. Contract Agent → Generates contract, gets signature
6. Confirmation Agent → Onboarding email + calendar series
```
**Conversion Rate**: Expected +30% for commercial deals

### Scenario 3: Recurring Service Setup

**Current (Single Agent)**:
- One-time booking only
- No recurring logic
- Manual setup for repeat customers

**With Multi-Agent (Future)**:
```
1. Qualifier Agent → Identifies recurring need
2. Pricing Agent → Calculates monthly rate with 15% discount
3. Scheduling Agent → Creates 52-week schedule
4. Contract Agent → Sets up auto-billing
5. Confirmation Agent → Welcome series + first reminder
```
**Automation**: 100% hands-off after initial setup

## Decision Points

### Question 1: Build vs Buy
**Options**:
- **Build custom** - Full control, tight integration
- **Use framework** - Temporal.io, Apache Airflow, AWS Step Functions
- **Hybrid** - Use queue service (BullMQ) + custom orchestration

**Recommendation**: Build custom for V1 (simpler), consider framework later

### Question 2: Agent Architecture
**Options**:
- **Monolithic** - All agents in one service
- **Microservices** - Each agent is separate service
- **Hybrid** - Agents as classes, orchestrator as service

**Recommendation**: Hybrid - Start with classes, split later if needed

### Question 3: State Storage
**Options**:
- **In-memory** - Fast but not persistent
- **SQLite** - Simple, file-based
- **Redis** - Fast, distributed
- **PostgreSQL** - Robust, relational

**Recommendation**: SQLite for V1 (consistent with current DB)

## Quick Start (When Ready to Build)

### Step 1: Create Workflow Engine
```javascript
// src/services/WorkflowEngine.js
export class WorkflowEngine {
  async executeWorkflow(workflowDef, initialContext) {
    const state = this.initializeState(workflowDef, initialContext);

    for (const step of workflowDef.steps) {
      if (this.shouldExecuteStep(step, state)) {
        const result = await this.executeStep(step, state);
        this.updateState(state, step, result);
      }
    }

    return state;
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Create Base Agent Class
```javascript
// src/services/BaseAgent.js
export class BaseAgent {
  async execute(input, context) {
    // Override in subclasses
    throw new Error('Must implement execute()');
  }

  async validate(input) {
    // Optional: validate input
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Create Specialized Agent
```javascript
// src/services/QualifierAgent.js
export class QualifierAgent extends BaseAgent {
  async execute(input, context) {
    const { customer_message } = input;

    // Lead scoring logic
    const leadScore = await this.calculateLeadScore(customer_message);

    return {
      is_qualified: leadScore > 60,
      lead_score: leadScore,
      service_type: this.detectServiceType(customer_message),
      urgency_level: this.assessUrgency(customer_message)
    };
  }
}
```
