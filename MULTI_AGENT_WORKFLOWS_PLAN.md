Task Queue → State Manager → Result Aggregator
```

### Components

1. **Workflow Engine** - Orchestrates multi-step processes
2. **Agent Pool** - Specialized agents for different tasks
3. **Task Queue** - Manages async task execution
4. **State Manager** - Tracks workflow progress
5. **Workflow Definitions** - Templates for common processes

---

## 2. Workflow Engine

### Core Concepts

**Workflow:** A series of tasks executed in sequence or parallel

**Task:** A single unit of work (e.g., "qualify lead", "check availability")

**Agent:** An AI model or service that executes a task

**State:** The current status and data of a workflow execution

### Workflow Definition

```javascript
{
  id: "booking_flow",
  name: "Complete Booking Workflow",
  version: "1.0",
  steps: [
    {
      id: "qualify",
      name: "Qualify Lead",
      agent: "qualifier_agent",
      input: ["customer_message"],
      output: ["is_qualified", "lead_score", "service_type"],
      retries: 2,
      timeout: 5000
    },
    {
      id: "schedule",
      name: "Schedule Appointment",
      agent: "scheduling_agent",
      input: ["service_type", "customer_availability"],
      output: ["appointment_date", "appointment_time"],
      condition: "is_qualified === true",
      retries: 3,
      timeout: 10000
    },
    {
      id: "confirm",
      name: "Send Confirmation",
      agent: "confirmation_agent",
      input: ["appointment_date", "appointment_time", "customer_email"],
      output: ["confirmation_sent"],
      retries: 2,
      timeout: 5000
    }
  ],
  errorHandling: {
    onError: "notify_human",
    fallbackWorkflow: "simple_booking_flow"
  }
}
```

### Execution Flow

```
1. Start Workflow
   ↓
2. Load Workflow Definition
   ↓
3. Initialize State
   ↓
4. For each step:
   ├─ Check condition (if any)
   ├─ Execute agent
   ├─ Update state
   └─ Handle errors
   ↓
5. Complete Workflow
   ↓
6. Return Results
```

---

## 5. State Management

### State Structure

```javascript
{
  workflowId: "wf_abc123",
  executionId: "exec_xyz789",
  status: "in_progress", // pending, in_progress, completed, failed
  currentStep: "schedule",
  steps: {
    qualify: {
      status: "completed",
      startTime: "2025-10-07T12:00:00Z",
      endTime: "2025-10-07T12:00:05Z",
      input: {...},
      output: {...},
      retries: 0
    },
    schedule: {
      status: "in_progress",
      startTime: "2025-10-07T12:00:05Z",
      endTime: null,
      input: {...},
      output: null,
      retries: 1
    }
  },
  context: {
    customer_id: "cust_123",
    service_type: "deep_cleaning",
    // Shared data across steps
  },
  errors: [],
  createdAt: "2025-10-07T12:00:00Z",
  updatedAt: "2025-10-07T12:00:05Z"
}
```

### State Transitions

```
PENDING → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED
              ↓
           FAILED → RETRY → IN_PROGRESS
                     ↓
                  ABORTED
```

### State Persistence

**Database Schema:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE workflow_executions (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  workflow_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT NOT NULL,
  current_step TEXT,
  state TEXT, -- JSON
  context TEXT, -- JSON
  started_at DATETIME,
  completed_at DATETIME,
  error_message TEXT
);
```

---

## 6. Task Queue

### Purpose

- **Async execution** of workflow steps
- **Load balancing** across agents
- **Priority handling** for urgent requests
- **Retry management** for failed tasks

### Queue Structure

```javascript
{
  taskId: "task_123",
  workflowExecutionId: "exec_xyz789",
  stepId: "schedule",
  priority: 5, // 1 (low) to 10 (high)
  agent: "scheduling_agent",
  input: {...},
  retries: 0,
  maxRetries: 3,
  timeout: 10000,
  createdAt: "2025-10-07T12:00:00Z",
  scheduledAt: "2025-10-07T12:00:00Z",
  startedAt: null,
  completedAt: null
}
```

### Priority Levels

1. **Emergency** (10): Emergency requests
2. **High** (7-9): Same-day requests, high-value leads
3. **Normal** (4-6): Standard bookings
4. **Low** (1-3): Follow-ups, non-urgent tasks

### Execution Strategy

**Sequential Steps:**

```
Step 1 completes → Step 2 starts → Step 3 starts
```

**Parallel Steps:**

```
Step 1 completes → [Step 2A, Step 2B, Step 2C] all start simultaneously
                 → Wait for all to complete
                 → Step 3 starts
```

---

## 7. Error Handling

### Retry Strategies

**Exponential Backoff:**

```
Retry 1: Wait 1s
Retry 2: Wait 2s
Retry 3: Wait 4s
```

**Fixed Delay:**

```
Retry 1: Wait 5s
Retry 2: Wait 5s
Retry 3: Wait 5s
```

### Fallback Workflows

**Primary workflow fails:**

```
Complex Sales Flow (failed at pricing step)
  ↓
Fallback: Simple Booking Flow (skip pricing, use standard rate)
```

### Human-in-the-Loop

**When to escalate:**

- All retries exhausted
- Critical step fails (e.g., payment processing)
- Customer explicitly requests human
- Workflow timeout exceeded

**Escalation process:**

```
1. Mark workflow as "needs_human"
2. Notify human agent
3. Provide full context and state
4. Human takes over or resumes workflow
```

## 8. Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Complete Booking Flow

**Scenario:** Customer wants deep cleaning for large house

**Workflow Steps:**

1. **Qualify Lead**
   - Input: "I need deep cleaning for my 4-bedroom house"
   - Agent: Qualifier Agent
   - Output: {is_qualified: true, service_type: "deep_cleaning", urgency: "medium"}

2. **Calculate Pricing**
   - Input: {service_type: "deep_cleaning", property_size: "4BR"}
   - Agent: Pricing Agent
   - Output: {estimated_cost: 350, duration: 6hrs}

3. **Schedule Appointment**
   - Input: {service_type, customer_availability}
   - Agent: Scheduling Agent
   - Output: {date: "2025-10-15", time: "09:00"}

4. **Send Confirmation**
   - Input: {appointment_details, customer_contact}
   - Agent: Confirmation Agent
   - Output: {confirmation_sent: true, id: "CONF-123"}

**Total Duration:** 8 minutes
**Success:** ✅ Booking completed

### Example 2: Failed Step with Retry

**Scenario:** Scheduling API temporarily down

**Workflow Steps:**

1. **Qualify Lead** ✅ Success
2. **Calculate Pricing** ✅ Success
3. **Schedule Appointment** ❌ Failed (API error)
   - Retry 1: Wait 1s → ❌ Failed
   - Retry 2: Wait 2s → ✅ Success
4. **Send Confirmation** ✅ Success

**Total Duration:** 10 minutes (includes retry delays)
**Success:** ✅ Booking completed after retry

### Example 3: Escalation to Human

**Scenario:** Complex custom request

**Workflow Steps:**

1. **Qualify Lead** ✅ Success
2. **Calculate Pricing** ⚠️ Partial (custom requirements not in pricing model)
3. **Escalate to Human**
   - Reason: "Custom pricing required for specialized equipment"
   - Context: Full conversation + partial pricing
4. **Human Agent** takes over

**Total Duration:** 5 minutes
**Success:** ⚠️ Escalated to human

## 12. Best Practices

### Workflow Design

**Keep workflows focused:**

- Each workflow has a single business goal
- Break complex processes into sub-workflows
- Limit to 5-7 steps per workflow

**Design for failure:**

- Add retries for network-dependent steps
- Define fallback workflows
- Set appropriate timeouts

**Optimize for cost:**

- Use caching for repeated calls
- Batch similar steps
- Choose appropriate agents (simple vs complex)

### Agent Design

**Single responsibility:**

- Each agent does one thing well
- Clear input/output contracts
- Stateless execution

**Idempotent operations:**

- Safe to retry without side effects
- Check if already completed before executing

**Error reporting:**

- Return structured errors
- Include context for debugging
- Suggest remediation steps
